# virus-spread-simulation


Simulate the spread of a virus in a population. I start currently with 2000 people.  
You can check the simulation live in this link: https://ucefizi.github.io/virus-spread-simulation/  

  
To run this just clone the repo and open the html file in a browser.
  
the simulation is made in under an hour so don't expect it to be half decent :).  
There are still so many things to improve so feel free to fork the repo to contribute to it.
